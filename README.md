## About

The classic Snake game, fully implemented on the MonoGame framework using the C# language. This project demonstrates an approach to the development of 2D games with a modular architecture, an extensible control system and a full-fledged user interface. Control the snake using the WASD keys, collect apples to increase its length and score points, avoid collisions with walls and your own body. The game offers three difficulty levels with unique parameters: easy (20 apples, low speed), medium (30 apples, medium speed) and difficult (40 apples, high speed). The scoring system displays the current progress, and when the target number of apples is reached or a collision occurs, corresponding screens appear with the possibility of restarting.
